*PYTHON*  

This a python project that grades a student based on there marks:   
we find the sum of the student marks using the *AND* operator  
and store it in a *variable*. We then find the average by diving   
the sum by the number of subjets that we added using the *slash* operator.   
Using *if-else statement* which allow conditional rendering, we print the  
grades based on the average. We also check if the average is a negative   
or greater that 100 then that cant be recognized.
